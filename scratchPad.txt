Problem Statement
Natural numbers are the set of positive integers, which ranges from 1 to infinity excluding fractional part. Natural numbers are whole numbers excluding zero. Zero is the only whole number which is not a natural number. An array is special if all the elements are natural numbers. Find whether the given array is special or not.

Input
The first line of input contains a single integer N denoting the array size. The second line of input contains N-space separated integers denoting the array.

Output
Print "Yes" if the array is special else print "No".

Constraints
1<=N<=100. 0<=Arrays elements<=100.

Sample Input
4
0 1 2 3

Sample Output

No


1. Get number of elements (N) in the array.

2. Get numbers separated by a space.

3. Put numbers into an array.

4. Create boolean flag

4. iterate over array and check if
   a. number is greater than 0.

5. if boolean flag is ever no, break the loop

6. print yes if boolean flag is true, no if false.
